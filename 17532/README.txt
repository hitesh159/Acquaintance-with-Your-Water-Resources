Acquaintance with Your Water Resources

Water is the most important
resource available to a human being.
To have clean water and knowledge
about the available resources is the
right of every human being living on
Earth. India faces a big challenge to
provide clean and safe water supply
to many areas. 
Our main purpose is to bridge the gap between the people living in that area
and the resources provided by the Government nearby.
Today, the main problem that the society faces is either lack of available
resources or not having the awareness and proper knowledge about the
available resources.
In our app, we intend to provide the solution to this problem using the data
available about the nearest source of water provided by the Government. We
will present the required information in a representable and understandable
manner.
